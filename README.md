<h1>Bubble-Sort</h1>

<h2>Description and Funcionalities</h2>
When creating this project I had the objective of performing the sort through a binary search, which is the Bubble Sort algorithm.
It sorts one number at a time in the list, always checking if the next number is less than the current one, if it is, swap, if not,
not (if it's in ascending order).This project was created exclusively with Java, and is not a web project.

<h2>How to use</h2>
To open this project on your machine it is necessary to have the Java SDK installed and some IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA or NetBeans. 
Download it, configure it on the machine and open the files.

Giovanna Cruz dos Santos(only me).
